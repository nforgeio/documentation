# Container Options

Used to customizes the cluster's container registry configuration.

```yaml
deployment:
  prefix: null
```

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>Property</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><b>registries</b></td>
			<td>
				`string`: Optional prefix combined with the cluster name to generate the resource group name
				when deploying the cluster to a cloud environment or combined with the node name
				for other environments.  This is typically used by unit tests deployed by <b>ClusterFixture</b>
				but can also be used by custom tools to avoid conflicts when multiple tests may be 
				running in parallel (probably on different machines) as well as providing a way to 
				identify and remove clusters or VMs orphaned by previous interrupted tests or tool runs.

				This will typically be set to something identifying the machine, user, and/or tool
				running the test like <b>runner-0</b>, <b>jeff</b>, or <b>runner-0-jeff</b>.

				<b>NOTE:</b> A dash will be appended automatically to non-`null` prefixes before prepending this
				to the cluster name.
