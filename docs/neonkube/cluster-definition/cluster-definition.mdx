# Cluster Definition

This documentation section describes the cluster definition format in detail.  Here's the
top-level structure of a cluster definition:

```yaml
ClusterDefinition:
  annotations:  {}
  container:    {}
  datacenter:   null
  deployment:   {}
  description:  null
  features:     {}
  hosting:      {}
  isDesktop:    false
  jobs:         {}
  kubernetes:   {}
  latitude:     null
  longitude:    null
  monitor:      {}
  name:         [required]
  network:      {}
  nodeOptions:  {}
  nodes:        {}
  packageProxy: null
  purpose:      "unspecified"
  resourceTags: []
  security:     {}
  storage:      {}
  timeSources:  ["pool.ntp.org"]
```

                [Kubernetes conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
                and the <b>neonkube.io/</b> prefix is reserved by NEONKUBE.

                or the region for clusters deployed to the cloud.

                <b>NOTE:</b> The name may include only letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.

            Names may include only letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores and
            may be up to 24 characters long.  Some hosting environments enforce length limits
            on resource names that we derive from the cluster name, so please limit your
            cluster name to 24 characters.

        <tr>
            <td><b>packageProxy</b></td>
            <td>
                `string:` Optionally specifies one or more APT proxy/cache servers the cluster will use to install
                and update Linux packages.  These are endpoints like <b>HOSTNAME:PORT</b> or <b>ADDRESS.PORT</b>
                of a <b>apt-cacher-ng</b> or other package proxy server.  The port is generally set to <b>3142</b>
                Multiple proxies may be specified by separating them with spaces.  This defaults to
                referencing the <b>apt-cacher-ng</b> instances running on the control-plane nodes.

                <b>NOTE:</b>
                The cluster nodes are configured to failover to different proxies or to hit the 
                default Linux distribution package mirror directly if any or all of the caches
                specified are unavailable.

                The package caches will be tried in the order they are listed.  This essentially
                makes the first cache primary, with the others acting as backups.

                 `array:` Optionally specifies custom tags that will be attached to cluster resources in cloud
                 hosting environments.  These tags are intended to help you manage your cloud resources
                 as well as help organize your cost reporting.
                 
                 <b>NOTE:</b> Currently, this is only supported for clusters deployed to AWS and Azure.

                `array:` Specifies the NTP time sources to be configured for the cluster.  These are the
                FQDNs or IP addresses of the sources.  This defaults to <b>pool.ntp.org</b>.
                
                The cluster control-plane nodes will be configured to synchronize their time with these
                time sources and the worker nodes will be configured to synchronize their time
                with the control-plane nodes.
