# Job Options

Specifies enhanced Quartz cron schedules for NEONKUBE cluster jobs performed by
cluster operators such as **neon-cluster-operator**.  Each job can be enabled
or disabled independently and scheduled using a CRON/Quartz like string, like:

```yaml
enabled:  true
schedule: "R R 0 ? * *"
```

**schedule** specifies the job schedule. This is extended Quartz CRON expression.  
This defaults to **"R R 0 ? * *"** which fires every day at a random minute and 
second between 12:00am and 1:00am.

Cron expressions consist of seven sub-expressions that describe the details of the 
schedule.  The sub expressions are:

- Seconds (0..59)
- Minutes (0..59)
- Hours (0..23)
- Day-of-Month (1..31)
- Month (1..12) or MON-DEC
- Day-of-Week (1..7) or SUN-SAT
- Year (optional) (1970..2099)

An example of a complete cron expression is **0 0 15 ? * MON** which triggers
**every Monday at 3pm**.

For the full documentation which describes special characters, see: 
[Quartz CRON Expressions](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/documentation/quartz-3.x/tutorial/crontriggers.html#cron-expressions)

:::note
In addition to the standard Quartz defined special characters, we also
support the <b>R</b> character which picks a random value within the
allow range for a field.  For example:

<b>0 0 R R * *</b>

schedules the job for a random hour and minute during the day.  This is useful
for situations like uploading telemetry to a global service where you don't
want a potentially large number of clients being scheduled to hit the
service at the same time.

Here's what the cluster job options look like, with the default values
or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
job:
  clusterCertificateRenewal:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  controlPlaneCertificateRenewal:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  harborImagePush:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  linuxSecurityPatches:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  nodeCaCertificateRenewal:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "0 0 0 ? * TUE"
  telemetryPing:
    enabled:  true
    schedule: "R R 0 ? * *"
```
