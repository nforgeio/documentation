# Network Options

Describes the network options for a cluster.

Here's what the monitoring options look like, with the default values
or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
network:
  acme:
    certificateDuration:    "2160h0m0s"
    certificateRenewBefore: "720h0m0s"
    issuer:                 null
  egressAddressRules:       []
  gateway:                  [second address in premiseSubnet]
  ingressHealthCheck:
    intervalSeconds:        10
    thresholdCount:         2
  ingressRules:             []
  managementAddressRules:   []
  mutalPodTls:              false
  nameServers:
  - "8.8.8.8"               [Google DNS for on-premise]
  - "8.8.4.4"               [otherwise use cloud DNS  ]
  nodeMtu:                  0
  premiseSubnet:            [required for on-premise]
  podSubnet:                "10.254.0.0/16"
  publicAddresses:          []
  reservedIngressEndPort:   64999

            <td><b>acme.certificateDuration</b></td>
            <td>
                `string:`  Specifies the maximum lifespan for internal cluster TLS certificates as a GOLANG formatted string.  
                This defaults to **2160h0m0s** (90 days).

                `string:` specifies the time to wait before attempting to renew internal cluster TLS certificates.
                This must be less than **acme.certificateDuration** and defaults to **720h0m0s** (24 days).

            <td><b>acme.issuer</b></td>
            <td>
                `string:` Optionally specifies the certificate issuer, including any configuration required by the issuer.
                This defaults to **null** which enables the standard NEONKUBE certificate issuer.

                for outbound traffic.  This defaults to allowing outbound traffic to anywhere 
                when the property is **null** or empty.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules)
                below for more information.
        
                **NOTE:** Address rules are processed in order from first to last, so you may 
                consider putting your blacklist rules before your whitelist rules.
        
                **NOTE:** These rules currently apply to all network ports.
        
                **NOTE:** This is currently supported only for clusters hosted on Azure.  AWS doesn't support
                this scenario and we currently don't support automatic router configuration for
                on-premise environments.

                nodes with <see cref="NodeDefinition.Ingress"/> enabled into one or more Istio ingress
                gateway services which are then responsible for routing to the target Kubernetes 
                services.  See [Address Rules](#address-rules) below for more information.

                node management via SSH NAT rules as well as cluster management via the 
                Kubernetes API via port 6443.  This defaults to allowing inbound traffic

                environments, this defaults to the [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns)

                split so that each node will be allocated its own subnet for the pods running there. 
                This defaults to (**)10.254.0.0/16**.

                into the cluster.

                `integer:` Optionally specifies the end of a range of ingress load balancer ports 
                reserved by NEONKUBE.  These are reserved for temporarily exposing SSH from individual 
                cluster nodes to the Internet during cluster setup as well as afterwards so that a 
                cluster node can be accessed remotely by a cluster operator as well as for other

                for the temporary SSH NAT rules plus another 100 ports reserved for other purposes.
                This range defaults to **64000-64999** which will support a cluster with up to

                to need expose to the Internet like HTTP/HTTPS (80/443).  You can change this range

## Address Rules
<a name="address-rules"/>

Address rules can be used white or blacklist external traffic to or from the
cluster.  The network **egressAddressRules**, **ingressRules**, and **managementAddressRules**
properties above may be set to an array of address rules to allow or deny traffic
for a specific IP address or subnet.

Here's what an address rule looks like, with the default values
or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
action:          [required]
addressOrSubnet: [required]
```

**addressOrSubnet** specifies can specify a single IP address or a CIDR/subnet specifying 
a range of IP addresses.  This can also be set to **"any"** which matches all possible IP
addresses.

**action** can be set to **allow** or **deny**, where **allow** lets network flow for the
IP address(es) and **deny** blocks the traffic.

Rules are applied in the order they appear in the list where the first rule that applies
to the traffic's IP address will be applied.  Traffic will be allowed when no rule matches.
