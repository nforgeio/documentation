# Node Definitions

Describes the machines that need to be deployed for a NeonKUBE cluster.
This is a map with the machine hostnames mapping to an object specifying
the requirements for each cluster node.

Here's what the node options look like, with the default values
or **[required]** for properties that must be specified:

```yaml
nodes:
  my-node: {
    address:               null
    aws:
      instanceType:        null
      ebsOptimized:        "default"
      placementPartition:  0
      volumeSize:          "default"
      storageType:         "default"
      diskSize:            null
      openEbsVolumeSize:   "default"
      openEbsStorageType:  "default"
      openEbsdiskSize:     null
    azure:
      vmSize:              null
      storageType:         "default"
      diskSize:            null
      openEbsStorageType: "default"
      openEbsDiskSize:     null
    hypervisor:
      host:                null
      vcpus:               0
      memory:              null
      osDisk:              null
      openEbsDisk:         null
    ingress:               false
    role:                  "worker"
    openEbsStorage:        false
    taints:                []
  }
}
```

The **address** property is required for on-premise hosting environments like **Hyper-V**
and **XenServer/XCP-ng**.  This is optional for cloud environments like **AWS** and **Azure**
where NeonKUBE will automatically assign IP addresses to node, but you can also assign
addresses to cloud nodes explicitly if you wish.

The **aws**, **azure**, and **hypervisor** allow you to override settings from the global 
cluster definition **hosting.aws**, **hosting.azure**, **hosting.hyperv** and **hosting.xenserver**
properties for individual cluster nodes.

                to be automatically assigned durining cluster setup.

                This is required for on-premise clusters deployed to Hype-V or XenServer/XCP-ng
                but is optional for cloud deployments.

                `bool:` Optionally specifies that this node should be configured to receive external network
                traffic on node ports and route that into the cluster.  This defaults to **false**.

                **NOTE:** If all nodes have **ingress: false** and the cluster defines one or more 
                **network.ingressRules** then NeonKUBE will choose a reasonable set of nodes to handle
                inbound traffic.

                 block device on this node for persistant container storage.  This defaults to **false**.
                
                **NOTE:**  When all nodes have **openEbsStorage** set to **false**, NeonKUBE 
                will automatically choose the nodes that will host the cStor/Mayastor block devices 
                by configuring up to three nodes with **openEbsStorage: true**, favoring worker nodes o
                ver control-plane nodes when possible.

                **NOTE:** When all nodes have **openEbsStorage set to **false** and **storage.openEbs.engine**
                in the cluster definitions is set to **cstor** or **mayastor**, NeonKUBE will automatically
                choose the nodes that will host the cStor/Maystor block devices by configuring up to three nodes to 
                do this, favoring **worker** nodes over **control-plane** nodes when possible.
