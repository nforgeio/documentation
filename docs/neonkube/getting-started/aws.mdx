# Deploy on AWS

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Accept the [NEONKUBE EULA](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/procurement?productId=e42b4534-a895-49d0-8c2e-1cafd10df38e)
- Your **AWS Access Key** and **Secret Key**

## Cluster Definition

First, you'll need to save this cluster definition as a YAML file
on your machine.  This provisions a single node cluster in **us-west-2a**
using a **c5.2xlarge** based instance (currently, the NEONKUBE default
instance size for AWS).

```yaml
name: my-aws-cluster
hosting:
  environment: aws
  aws:
    accessKeyId: [ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    secretAccessKey: [SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
    availabilityZone: us-west-2a
    defaultEbsOptimized: true
nodes:
  control-0:
    role: control-plane
```

Save the cluster definition somewhere on your disk, being sure to substitute 
your own AWS credentials for:

- **[ACCESS_KEY_ID]**
- **[SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]**

:::note
We plan on eventually integrating with AWS IAM Roles so AWS authntication
will be more secure.

## Cluster Deployment via NEONDESKTOP

1. Right click the NEONDESKTOP icon in the taskbar > Deploy cluster
   <Image img={require("./assets/deploy-cluster.png")} style={{ width: 300 }} />

2. Use the file picker to select the cluster definiton file you saved above

3. Grab a coffee and wait for NEONDESKTOP to deploy the cluster.

## Cluster Deployment via NEONCLI

Cluster deployment happens in two phases:

- Configuring the hosting infrastructure, which involves configuring the 
  **Resource Group**, **VPC**, starting the **Instances**, configuring 
  the **LoadBalancer**, **IP Addresses**, **Disks**, etc.

- Setting up the cluster.  This involves configuring Linux and Kubernetes
  and then installing the necessary cluster components via Helm charts.

Execute the commands to deploy this cluster, passing the **PATH** to the
cluster definition file you saved above and **CLUSTERNAME** to the cluster
name as defined in the definition:

```plain
REM Prepare the cluster infrastructure (change PATH to your cluster definition path)
neon cluster prepare PATH

REM Setup the cluster
neon cluster setup root@my-aws-cluster
```

Then wait for cluster setup to complete.

:::note
These operations are currently coordinated by NEONDESKTOP or NEONCLI 
running on your machine, so you'll need to keep your computer running
and connected to the network.

We plan on supporting cloud based deployment in the future where these
operations will be managed in the cloud, rather than from your computer.
