# Cluster Definitions

NeonDESKTOP and NeonCLI are used to deploy Kubernetes clusters from your
workstation or laptop. After setup and when started for the first time,
NeonDESKTOP prompts to create a local **desktop cluster** with reasonable
settings.

NeonDESKTOP and NeonCLI can also deploy clusters on the local machine using
Windows Hyper-V to host the cluster node virtual machines (VMs) or on-premise
using one or more [XenServer](https://xenserver.com) or the open source
[XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org) hypervisors running on one or more servers. These
tools can also deploy to the Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure clouds.

You'll need a cluster definition to deploy anything besides a NeonDESKTOP
cluster (that definition is baked into the NeonDESKTOP app). A cluster
definition is simply a **YAML** file describing the required nodes, network,
hosting credentials, and other cluster configuration. Here's a simple cluster
definition that deploys a single node cluster hosted by Hyper-V on your Windows
laptop or workstation:

<Image
  className="w-full max-w-4xl"
  img={require("./assets/cluster-definition/clusterdef-hyperv.png")}
/>

This minimal definition describes a cluster named **my-cluster** that will be
hosted by **hyperv** on the local machine. We specified the local LAN subnet and
gateway address and specified the nodes **name**, cluster **role** and IP
**address** as well as the **memory**, **disk**, and **virtual CPUs** to be
assigned to the Hyper-V virtual machine created for the node.

:::note
On-premise hosting environments like Hyper-V and XenServer/XCP-ng need to know
about the LAN configuration, including the LAN subnet and upstream gateway's IP
address. You also need to specify the IP address for each node.

This all is optional for cloud environments where we configure the virtual
network there with default settings and automatically assign node IP addresses.
This can be custoimized though, if required.
:::

Here's another cluster definition example that deploys a four node cluster to
Azure:

<Image
  className="w-full max-w-4xl"
  img={require("./assets/cluster-definition/clusterdef-azure.png")}
/>

You can see that we've selected the **azure** hosting environment and then
specified additional Azure related settings such as the Azure credentials
NeonKUBE will need to provison the cluster infrastructure as well as the target
region and default VM size.

Notice that we use the `$<env:VARIABLE>` syntax to inject environment variables
holding the Azure credentials into the cluster definition. We could have just
pasted the credentials into the definition, but that generally not a good idea.

:::note
The NeonFORGE team uses an internal tool that can inject secrets from the
[1Password](https://1password.com/) password manager. We might release a public
version of this tool if there's interest.
