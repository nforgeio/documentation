# Getting Started

This documentation section will describe how to **install NEONKUBE**,
give a brief overview of how **cluster definitions** are used to
describe how to deploy a cluster.

Then we have some simple cluster deployment examples for **NEONDESKTOP** 
as well as **AWS**, **Azure**, and **XenServer/XCP-ng**.
