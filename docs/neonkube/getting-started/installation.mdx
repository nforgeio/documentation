# Installation

NEONKUBE releases are located in our NEONKUBE GitHub Repository here:

https://github.com/nforgeio/neonKUBE/releases

Click on a release (generally the most recent) and then scroll down
to the bottom of the release page to locate the **Assets**:

<Image img={require("./assets/installation/github-release.png")} style={{ width: 700 }} />

You'll find the two installer downloads there, one that installs the **NEONCLI**
tool (a gently extended version of the Kubernetes **kubectl** client).  Note that
this also installs other Kubernetes related tools like **Helm** and **Kustomize**.

:::note
Both of these installers currently target **only Microsoft Windows**.  We're planning
on supporting NEONCLI on macOS and Linux (which should be relatively easy) and are
considering having NEONDESKTOP support macOS in the future (which will be harder).
:::

Download and run **neon-cli.#-win.amd64.exe** to install **NEONCLI** and then open a 
new command window to pick up the new environment variables such as **PATH**.

:::note
The NEONCLI tool is named: **neon**
:::

You can verify the installation by having NEONCLI print out its version:

```plain
C:\ neon version --client
WARNING: This version information is deprecated and will be replaced with the output from neon version --short.  Use --output=yaml|json to get the full version.
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"24+", GitVersion:"v1.24.14-67+387fe22d102081", GitCommit:"387fe22d1020817d2e77edf640b21d33c5ea97ce", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2024-03-10T15:08:56Z", GoVersion:"go1.20.7", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"windows/amd64"}
Kustomize Version: v4.5.4
neon-cli Version: 0.10.0-beta.6
Helm Version: 3.12.0
```

Download and run **neon-desktop.#-win.amd64.exe** to install **NEONDESKTOP** as
well as **NEONCLI**, which is included.  Note that NEONDESKTOP lives in the Windows
taskbar:

<Image img={require("./assets/installation/desktop-taskbar.png")} style={{ width: 500 }} />

This is the NEONDESKTOP icon.  It will be **green** when connected to a cluster, **blinking 
yellow** when an operation is in progress, **red** when there's a problem with the current
cluster, and **clear** when not connected to a cluster.  Right-click on this icon to display 
the application menu.
