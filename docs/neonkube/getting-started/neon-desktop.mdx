# Deploy with NEONDESKTOP

An easy way to get started with NEONKUBE and Kubernetes is to install **NEONDESKTOP**
and have it install a local desktop cluster.

## Requirements

- Windows Home or Professional
- CPU: 4+ cores
- Disk: 500GB with 84GB free
- Memory: 16GB

## Installation

Download and run the NEONDESKTOP installer from one of our releases at:

https://github.com/nforgeio/neonKUBE/releases

This configures Hyper-V and also installs NEONDESKTOP.  You may be prompted to
reboot your machine (e.g. when Hyper-V was not already installed and enabled).

NEONDESKTOP will prompt to deploy a local desktop cluster the first time it
runs.  You can choose to do this right away or later via the NEONDESKTOP
taskbar menu.

## Operations

After a cluster is deployed, you can use the taskbar menu to perform operations
like: starting, stopping, pausing, removing, displaying dashboards, etc.  You'll
also be able to use the **neon** command line tool to manipulate the cluster.

:::note
The dashboards are secured by free TLS certificates generated by our integration
with [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/)
as well as a user ID and password.

NEONKUBE includes the infrastructure required to authenticate users against external
OAuth providers like GitHub, Google, Microsoft as well as enterprise solutions
like Active Directory.  Unfortunately, we haven't enabled this support yet so we
rely on internal cluster authentication against a **root** user.

We currently generate a secure password for the **root** user.  You can obtain this
using the NEONDESKTOP **Copy/SSO password to clipboard** menu and then pasting that
into the dashboard's login window.  For clusters deployed via NEONCLI, you can 
locate the SSO password by searching for **"ssoPassword"** in the Kubernetes
config file located at:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config
```

This isn't ideal or particularily secure and we plan on improving the installation
process by integrating with external OAuth providers or at least prompting the user
for a password rather than autogenerating one.
