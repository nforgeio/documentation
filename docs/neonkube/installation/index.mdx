# Getting Started

To use NeonKUBE, you will need to install
[NeonDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop), a desktop application
that provides a graphical user interface for NeonKUBE. With NeonDESKTOP, you can
easily deploy and manage NeonKUBE clusters on your preferred platform, such as
AWS, Azure, Hyper-V, or XenServer.

Once you have [NeonDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop) installed,
go ahead and check out the instructions for deploying NeonKUBE on your preferred
platform.

- [NeonDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop-cluster) - NeonDESKTOP
  is a full NeonKUBE cluster running on your desktop machine.
- [Azure](/docs/neonkube/installation/azure) - How to deploy a cluster to Azure.
- [XenServer](/docs/neonkube/installation/xenserver) - How to deploy a cluster
  to XenServer.
