# Getting Started

To use NEONKUBE, you will need to install
[NEONDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop), a desktop application
that provides a graphical user interface for NEONKUBE. With NEONDESKTOP, you can
easily deploy and manage NEONKUBE clusters on your preferred platform, such as
AWS, Azure, Hyper-V, or XenServer.

Once you have [NEONDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop) installed,
go ahead and check out the instructions for deploying NEONKUBE on your preferred
platform.

- [NEONDESKTOP](/docs/neonkube/installation/neon-desktop-cluster) - NEONDESKTOP
  is a full NEONKUBE cluster running on your desktop machine.
- [Azure](/docs/neonkube/installation/azure) - How to deploy a cluster to Azure.
- [XenServer](/docs/neonkube/installation/xenserver) - How to deploy a cluster
  to XenServer.
