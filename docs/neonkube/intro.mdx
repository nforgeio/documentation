# Introduction

NEONKUBE is a full-stack, production-ready Kubernetes distribution that aims to
provide a seamless and consistent developer experience across different
environments. Whether you want to run your applications on your laptop,
on-premise servers, or on the cloud, NEONKUBE can help you deploy and manage
them with ease.

With NEONKUBE, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- **Simplicity**: You don't have to worry about installing and configuring
  dozens of different tools and components. You can simply use neon-cli or
  NEONDESKTOP to create a cluster with a single command or click.
- **Consistency**: You don't have to deal with different versions or
  configurations of Kubernetes or its add-ons across different environments or
  platforms. You can use the same NEONKUBE distribution everywhere.
- **Reliability**: You don't have to worry about compatibility issues or bugs
  caused by mismatched components or dependencies. You can rely on NEONKUBE's
  tested and stable components.
- **Productivity**: You don't have to waste time on tedious tasks like setting
  up VPNs or SSH tunnels. You can use NEONDESKTOP's intuitive interface or
  neon-cli's powerful commands to access and manage your cluster easily.
