:::note
The current release is **alpha** quality and is based on Kubernetes v1.24,
which is somewhat dated.  We're in the process of upgrading to Kubernetes
v1.29 and are also switching to the [Cilium CNI](https://cilium.io/get-started/)
which will provide much better networking performance for larger clusters.

# Introduction

NEONKUBE is a full-stack, production-ready Kubernetes distribution that 
provides a seamless and consistent developer experience across different
environments. Whether you want to run your applications on your laptop,
on-premise servers or on the cloud, NEONKUBE can help you deploy and manage
clusters with ease.

Basic Kubernetes isn't really production ready because it doesn't include
the components required to manage clusters as well as other generally useful
features.  Kubernetes distributions like NEONKUBE layer useful components
onto basic Kubernetes and also manage cluster deployment.

NEONKUBE curates several best-of-breed open source components and implements
cluster deployment to a Windows workstation or laptop, on-premise using
[XenServer](https://www.xenserver.com/) or a free and compaitible open source 
alternative [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/).

With NEONKUBE, you will enjoy benefits like:

- **Simplicity**: You don't have to worry about installing and configuring
  dozens of different tools and components. NEONKUBE handles all of that.

- **Consistency**: You don't have to deal with different versions or
  configurations of Kubernetes or its add-ons across different environments or
  platforms. You can use the same NEONKUBE distribution everywhere.

- **Reliability**: You don't have to worry about compatibility issues or bugs
  caused by mismatched components or dependencies. You can rely on NEONKUBE's
  tested and stable components.

- **Productivity**: You don't have to waste time on tedious tasks like setting
  up VPNs or SSH tunnels. You can use NEONDESKTOP's intuitive interface or
  NEONCLI's powerful commands to access and manage your cluster easily.

## NEONDESKTOP and NEONCLI

**NEONKUBE** provides two ways to deploy and interact with Kubernetes clusters.
**NEONDESKTOP** is a Microsoft Windows GUI application that can deploy and manage
a local single node cluster on a laptop or workstation with a **500GB+ SSD** and
at least **16GB RAM** (more is better).  We're planning on eventually releasing
NEONDESKTOP for the Macintosh and perhaps eventually for Linux Desktop.

**NEONCLI** is our command line management tool.  This is is derived from the
standard Kubernetes **kubectl** tool, including all of the standard commands
as well as new NEONKUBE-specific commands.

**NEONDESKTOP** is similar to **Docker Desktop** in Kubernetes mode in that
it can manage a single node cluster on your computer, but **NEONDESKTOP**
deploys a full-stack cluster with the curated components.  NEONDESKTOP 
clusters are intended for learning about Kubernetes and these components
and doing some lite development.  NEONDESKTOP clusters are **not intended
for production**.

We publish two installers, one for NEONDESKTOP which also includes NEONCLI and 
another that installs only NEONCLI.
