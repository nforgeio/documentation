# Security

The `neon-cluster-operator` is a service that runs in every NEONKUBE cluster. It
is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the cluster, including certificate
rotation and security updates. Certificate rotation is the process of
periodically generating new cryptographic keys and certificates for the cluster
components, such as the API server, the etcd database, and the kubelet agents.
This ensures that the communication between these components is secure and
authenticated, and that any compromised or expired certificates are replaced.
Security updates are patches or fixes that address vulnerabilities or bugs in
the cluster software or operating system. The `neon-cluster-operator` monitors
for available security updates and applies them to all nodes in the cluster
automatically or on demand. This ensures that the cluster is protected from
potential attacks and runs smoothly and reliably.
