## Persistence Types

neonKUBE provides multiple persistence tpyes for different applications. The main types are file storage, block storage and object storage.

### Network File System

The most commonly used storage type is Network File System (NFS). NFS supports `ReadWriteMany` and can be used for small applications requiring shared access to files.

:::note

NFS is relatively slow and is not a good option for complex applications requiring fast operations.

### Block Storage

Block Storage volumes are dynamically provisioned storage volumes. Using this mode, each pod in the application will have a separate Persistent Volume.
