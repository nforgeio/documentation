# Best Practices

## Implementing a Reconciler

### Idempotency

Reconcile is called for every event received from the Controller, which could be
multiple times for the same resource. This includes listing all resources the
first time the Operator starts or restarts. It is important that reconciliation
is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).

A function is said to be idempotent if it can be applied multiple times without
changing the result beyond the initial application.

### Reconcile All Resources All the Time

Reconciliation can be triggered from many different event sources. It could be
tempting to check the event to try to figure out what needs reconciling, but
this is considered to be an anti-pattern for Operators. Because of the
distributed nature of Kubernetes, it's possible that the Operator did not
receive all events and in this situation making assumptions about the current
state could be dangerous. For this reason it is best practice to reconcile all
resources all the time.

### Owner References

Dependent objects created by the Reconciler should have an Owner Reference that
references their owner resource. This will allow Kubernetes to clean up
resources when the parent resource is deleted.

:::info

Cross-namespace owner references are disallowed by design. Namespaced dependents
can specify cluster-scoped or namespaced owners. A namespaced owner must exist
in the same namespace as the dependent. If it does not, the owner reference is
treated as absent, and the dependent is subject to deletion once all owners are
verified absent.

Cluster-scoped dependents can only specify cluster-scoped owners. In v1.20+, if
a cluster-scoped dependent specifies a namespaced kind as an owner, it is
treated as having an unresolvable owner reference, and is not able to be garbage
collected.

For cross-namespace garbage collection, use a [`Finalizer`](./finalizers).

:::

Owner references can be created by calling the `MakeOwnerReference()` extension
method on any resource.

```csharp
var pod = new V1Pod().Initialize()
pod.AddOwnerReference(resource.MakeOwnerReference());
```
