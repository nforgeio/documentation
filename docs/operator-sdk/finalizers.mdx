# Resource Finalizers

## Introduction

Finalizers are namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific
conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. When
you tell Kubernetes to delete an object that has finalizers specified for it,
the Kubernetes API will mark the object for deletion. The object will only be
deleted once the finalizers have run successfully.

Finalizers can be used for garbage collection of resources. For example, you can
define a finalizer to clean up any related resources before deleting the target
resource.

Finalizers can also be used to prevent accidental deletion of resources.

## Example

```csharp
public class ExampleFinalizer : IResourceFinalizer<V1ExampleEntity>
{
    public async Task FinalizeAsync(V1ExampleEntity resource)
    {
        // Run finalizer for given entity.
    }
}
```
