# Introduction

The Neon Operator SDK provides tools to build, test and package Kubernetes
Operators in .NET.

## What is an Operator?

An Operator is an application specific controller that extends the Kubernetes
API. It acts on behalf of a user to create, configure, and manage instances of
complex applications. Essentially, Operators automate software configuration and
maintenance tasks that are typically performed by a human operator.

For more, see the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).
