# Local Development

## Visual Studio Dev Tunnels

When running your Operator in Visual Studio, it's possible to create a tunnel
using
[Visual Studio Dev Tunnels](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/dev-tunnels-in-visual-studio-for-asp-net-core-projects/).
This will allow you to debug your webhooks live in Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

- Download
  [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- You will also need to be signed into Visual Studio to create and use dev
  tunnels.
- Enable the dev tunnels preview feature. You can find this at
  <strong>Tools</strong> -> <strong>Options</strong> ->
  <strong>Environment</strong> -> <strong>Preview Features</strong>, and select
  the option Enable dev tunnels for Web Applications.

### Setup

Add the following properties to your profile in `launchsettings.json`

```json
"devTunnelEnabled": true,
"devTunnelAccess": "Public"
```

That's it! The rest will be taken care of when you start your Operator.
